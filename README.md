## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I discovered the *box-shadow* property:

```css
button.payment {
    box-shadow: 0px 1px 18px var(--desaturated-blue);
}
```

### Continued development

I'm now understanding the basic concepts of HTML5 and CSS3, but I still need practice. 
*Good practice makes you perfect*.

### Useful resources

- [W3 schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - This helped to find and understand every property in css and every tag in html5.
